I’m José, a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My academic interests mainly lie in the fields of Compilers, Computer Architecture, and Embedded Systems! Previously, I’ve worked at Evertec for two summers as a Software Engineering intern, developing security-critical financial tech services.</p> <p>Currently, I’m working on reverse-engineering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> to be able to run on an FPGA. The project is divided into two parts, a Rust reference emulator, and the actual hardware implementation in SystemVerilog. You can check out updates on both parts here!</p> </body></html>
