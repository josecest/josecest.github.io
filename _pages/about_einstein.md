Hi! I'm Jos√©, a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My academic interests mainly lie in the fields of Compilers, Computer Architecture, and Embedded Systems! Previously, I've worked at Evertec for two summers as a Software Engineering intern, working on security-critical financial tech services. 

Currently, I'm working on reverse-engineering the [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) to be able to run on an FPGA. The project is divided into two parts, a Rust reference emulator, and the actual hardware implementation in SystemVerilog. You can check out updates on both parts here!



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
